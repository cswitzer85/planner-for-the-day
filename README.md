# planner-for-the-day
An application that can be used to plan out your day> It displays past, current and future events and can be updated throughout the day..

# Getting started
When the page is opened it will display a title section and todays date
Below, a series of time slots will be easily identified by the respective time on the left
Past time slots have a grey background color.
The current time slot has a red background color.
Future time slots have a green background color.
Default events can be changed or a new event added, by simlpy typing in the field to the right of the time slot.
Once all changes for that time slot have been made, press the save button/icon on the far right of the time slot.
The page can be refreshed and any saved events will remain; however, unsaved events will be lost.
Repeat as your day changes and come back tomorrow to do it all again!

# SPECIAL BUTTONS
Need to clear your schedule quickly, or maybe something came up and you need to block everything.
There's a botton for both of those situations!
To clear all cells click the blank calendar button to the left of "Work Day Scheduler" at the top of the page.
To block all cells click the full calendar button to the right of "Work Day Scheduler" at the top of the page.
