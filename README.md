# planner-for-the-day
An application that can be used to plan out your day> It displays past, current and future events and can be updated throughout the day..

# Getting started
When the page is opened it will display a title section and todays date
Below, a series of time slots will be easily identified by the respective time on the left
Past time slots have a grey background color.
The current time slot has a red background color.
Future time slots have a green background color.
Default events can be changed or a new event added, by simlpy typing in the field to the right of the time slot.
Once all changes for that time slot have been made, press the save button/icon on the far right of the time slot.
The page can be refreshed and any saved events will remain; however, unsaved events will be lost.
Repeat as your day changes and come back tomorrow to do it all again!


# What needs are satisified?
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

# How it works
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
